                        My master thesis was part of project Icarus (see <a href="icarus_description.html"> this page</a>) and supervised by 
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-jones-b04a663/"> Professor Colin Jones</a>
                        and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-listov-66b41856/">Dr. Peter Listov</a> of the
                        Automatic Control Laboratory at EPFL.
                        <br>
                        Besides managing the project, I had to work on new guidance, navigation, and control (GNC)
                        algorithms for our student-developed rockets.
                        <br>

                        I developed two Model Predictive Control algorithms: one for attitude and position tracking,
                        and the other one for optimal trajectory planning.

                        </figure>

                        I realized the need for a 
                        common framework for better cooperation between the student projects, so I developed
                        the open-source <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/real_time_simulator">real_time_simulator</a>
                        project based on ROS, which defines a modular software and hardware architecture, an interface
                        to a custom real-time rocket simulator, and to our test bench for Hardware-in-the-Loop tests.

                        <br>
                        This framework was used by two major projects last year. The first one was
                        for a custom drone we built as a test platform for our algorithms. 
                        Most of these algorithms were developed by 
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-linsen/">RaphaÃ«l Linsen</a>,
                        then tested with the team. You can find more information on
                        our recent <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/288898">paper</a> to ICRA.
                        <br>

                            <img src="../images/thesis/drone_prototype.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded border border-secondary " alt="custom drone">

                        </figure>
                        
                        The second project was an altitude controller for
                        our Bellalui 2 rocket flying at the 2021 EuRoc competition.
                        The goal was to reach a precise altitude at apogee 
                        by controlling the shutdown time of our engine to reach the apogee ballistically.
                        I used my MPC-based trajectory planner to predict the apogee and a continuous-time
                        Kalman filter to estimate the rocket state. As we only have one chance to launch the rocket,
                        the biggest challenge for me was to test the GNC reliably on the ground. 
                        Using my simulator, we could do software and processor-in-the-loop tests,
                        so the final GNC was completely nominal during the launch and 
                        our team won the European competition!

                        <br>

                        I am continuing to develop this framework as of today, as a new generation of student
                        is continuing our work and need support to develop new features. One of our objective
                        is to finish the development of the test bench and its integration with the simulator
                        to do Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation.
